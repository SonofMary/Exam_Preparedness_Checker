This means 1 dm³ of saturated solution contains 1.414 × 10⁻⁵ moles of Ag⁺ (and thus of Ag lost). For 10 dm³ of wash water, the total moles of Ag lost = solubility × volume = (1.414 × 10⁻⁵ mol/dm³) × 10 dm³ = 1.414 × 10⁻⁴ moles. The question asks for quantity in moles. However, the options provided in the original question (2.029×10⁻³, 1.414×10⁻³, 2.029×10⁻⁵, 1.414×10⁻⁵) suggest they might be asking for the concentration or have a different interpretation.

Given the options, 1.414×10⁻⁵ is listed, which is the molar solubility. I'll provide the calculated value. The quantity lost in 10 dm³ is 1.414×10⁻⁴ mol.",
